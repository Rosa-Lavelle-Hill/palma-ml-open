# How the Predictors of Math Achievement Change over Time: A Longitudinal Machine Learning Approach

This repository includes code for the analyses presented in the paper "How the Predictors of Math Achievement Change over Time:
A Longitudinal Machine Learning Approach" (Lavelle-Hill et al., preprint).

For the "_next year prediction_" analysis see "Analysis_2" for prediction and "Analysis_3" for the SHAP interpretation analysis.
For the "_varying lag prediction_" see "Predict_X_years_ahead" for prediction and interpretation.

Note that this repository does not include any data files. Data files can be granted upon reasonable request to the authors.
