# How the Predictors of Math Achievement Change over Time: A Longitudinal Machine Learning Approach

This repository includes all initial analyses ran for the "next year prediction" (Analyses 1-8) and "varying lag prediction" ("Predict_X_years_ahead"). The results presented for the "next year prediction" in the article are those from Analysis 3. The code and results from all analyses conducted are uploaded here for full transparency.

Note: all 8 analyses were ran both with and without "sges_T1" (previous math ability). The same methodology as Analysis 3 in the "next year prediction" was implemented for "varying lag prediction" ("Predict_X_years_ahead").

This repository does not include any data files. Data files can be granted upon reasonable request to the authors.
